# Assessing Data Size Requirements For Training Generalizable Sequence-based TCR Specificity Models Via Pan-allelic MHC-I Non-self Ligandome Evaluation

This repository contains the companion code for the paper [Assessing Data Size Requirements For Training Generalizable Sequence-based TCR Specificity Models Via Pan-allelic MHC-I Non-self Ligandome Evaluation](https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-6446591/v1) by Delaunay A., McGibbon M et al.

# Usage

The repository follows the structure of the paper:

* The `models_benchmark` folder contains all code relevant for preparing the benchmark dataset, calculating bootstrapped ROC-AUC of models' specificity prediction and reproducing the paper's visualization plots.

* The `ligandome` folder contains the code for reproducing the ligandome computation workflow on public data. 

Please refer to each folder's README file for environment setup and specific usage instructions.
