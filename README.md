# Assessing Data Size Requirements For Training Generalizable Sequence-based Models of TCR-antigen Specificity Based on Pan-allelic MHC-I Non-self Ligandome Estimation

This repository contains the companion code for the paper [Assessing data size requirements for training generalizable sequence-based models for TCR-antigen specificity based on pan-allelic MHC-I non-self ligandome estimation]() by Delaunay A., McGibbon M et al.

# Usage

The repository follows the structure of the paper:

* The `models_benchmark` folder contains all code relevant for preparing the benchmark dataset, calculating bootstrapped ROC-AUC of models' specificity prediction and reproducing the paper's visualization plots.

* The `ligandome` folder contains the code for reproducing the ligandome computation workflow on public data. 

Please refer to each folder's README file for environment setup and specific usage instructions.
